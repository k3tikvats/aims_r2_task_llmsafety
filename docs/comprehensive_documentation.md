```

#### 3. Safety-Aware Prompt Engineering

**Chain-of-Thought for Safety**:

```
"Before responding, let me think step by step about the safety implications:

2. Could this information be misused?
3. What are safer alternatives I can provide?"
```

**Explicit Safety Constraints**:

```
"I need to provide helpful information while ensuring safety and legality..."
```

## Methodology

### 1. Red Teaming Methodology

#### Phase 1: Systematic Prompt Generation

- **Template-based**: Structured prompt templates across risk categories
- **Manual Crafting**: Expert-designed adversarial prompts
- **Automated Generation**: LLM-assisted prompt creation
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement based on results

#### Phase 2: Response Collection

The response collection system systematically gathers LLM outputs using a ResponseCollector class that iterates through multiple models and prompts. For each model-prompt combination, responses are generated with controlled parameters (max length 512 tokens, temperature 0.7, sampling enabled) and stored with comprehensive metadata including timestamps and model identifiers.

#### Phase 3: Safety Labeling

- **Three-Class System**: Safe, Moderate Risk, High Risk
- **Annotation Guidelines**: Detailed criteria for each class
- **Inter-Annotator Agreement**: Kappa coefficient > 0.75
- **Quality Control**: Regular calibration sessions

### 2. Data Collection and Preprocessing

#### Dataset Composition

- **Adversarial Prompts**: 5,000+ generated prompts
- **LLM Responses**: 15,000+ collected responses
- **Safety Labels**: Manual annotations with quality control
- **External Datasets**: Integration with established safety datasets

#### Preprocessing Pipeline

The text preprocessing pipeline normalizes input text through multiple steps: converting to lowercase, removing excessive whitespace with regex patterns, and tokenizing for classification using the tokenizer with 512 max length, truncation enabled, padding applied, and PyTorch tensor output format.

### 3. Evaluation Methodology

#### Metrics Used

- **Classification Accuracy**: Overall correctness of safety predictions
- **Precision/Recall**: Per-class performance metrics
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
- **Processing Time**: Latency measurements for real-time applicability

#### Evaluation Framework

The SafetyEvaluator class provides comprehensive model evaluation by iterating through test samples, measuring prediction accuracy and processing times. For each sample, it records the prediction time, compares predicted vs ground truth labels, and calculates weighted accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and average processing time metrics.

## Safety Classification System

### Architecture

#### Model Selection Rationale

- **DistilBERT**: Chosen for optimal speed-accuracy tradeoff
- **Parameter Efficiency**: 66M parameters vs 110M in BERT-base
- **Inference Speed**: 2x faster than BERT while maintaining 97% accuracy
- **Memory Footprint**: Reduced memory requirements for production deployment

#### Training Configuration

The training configuration uses DistilBERT-base-uncased with 3 output labels, learning rate of 2e-5, batch size of 16, training for 3 epochs with 500 warmup steps, weight decay of 0.01, and gradient clipping at norm 1.0 for stable training.

#### Class Definitions

1. **Safe (Class 0)**

   - Benign content with no safety concerns
   - Educational or informational requests
   - Normal conversational exchanges

2. **Moderate Risk (Class 1)**

   - Potentially concerning but context-dependent
   - Requests requiring careful response
   - Content needing additional safeguards

3. **High Risk (Class 2)**
   - Clearly harmful or dangerous content
   - Illegal activity instructions
   - Content requiring immediate blocking

### Training Process

#### Data Preparation

The data preparation process balances the dataset across classes using undersampling strategy, splits data into train/validation/test sets with 70/15/15 ratios, and creates data loaders with batch size 16 (shuffled for training, sequential for validation).

#### Model Training

The SafetyClassifierTrainer implements a standard training loop over multiple epochs. In each epoch, it performs training phase with gradient computation, loss backpropagation, gradient clipping, and optimizer steps, followed by validation phase to evaluate accuracy. The best performing model based on validation accuracy is saved for later use.

### Performance Results

#### Classification Metrics

- **Overall Accuracy**: 92.3%
- **Class-wise Performance**:
  - Safe: Precision=0.94, Recall=0.95, F1=0.945
  - Moderate Risk: Precision=0.89, Recall=0.87, F1=0.880
  - High Risk: Precision=0.93, Recall=0.96, F1=0.945
- **Average Processing Time**: 45ms per classification
- **Model Size**: 255MB (suitable for production deployment)

## Mitigation Techniques

### 1. Rejection Sampling

#### Principle

Rejection sampling generates multiple candidate responses and selects the safest one based on safety classifier scores.

#### Implementation

The rejection sampling approach generates multiple candidate responses with varying temperatures and selects the safest one based on safety classifier scores. The system attempts up to 5 generations per prompt, with early termination if a sufficiently safe response is found.

**Key Parameters**:

- Maximum attempts: 5 generations
- Temperature variation: 0.7 to 1.1
- Safety threshold: 0.9 confidence for early termination
- Quality preservation: Maintains 96% of original response quality

#### Performance Impact

- **Safety Improvement**: 34% reduction in unsafe responses
- **Latency Cost**: 2.3x increase in response time
- **Quality Maintenance**: 96% of original response quality retained

### 2. Chain-of-Thought Moderation

#### Principle

Explicit reasoning about safety implications before generating the final response.

#### Implementation

The chain-of-thought moderation uses a structured prompt template that explicitly reasons through safety implications before generating the final response. The system performs safety analysis, risk assessment, and determines appropriate response strategy.

**Safety Reasoning Steps**:

1. **Safety Analysis**: Identifies potential risks in the user prompt
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates severity and likelihood of harm
3. **Response Strategy**: Determines appropriate approach (direct answer, educational response, or refusal)
4. **Final Response**: Generates response based on the safety analysis

**Template Structure**: Uses a predefined template that guides the model through explicit safety reasoning while maintaining response quality and coherence.

#### Effectiveness Metrics

- **Safety Enhancement**: 28% improvement in safety scores
- **Response Coherence**: Maintained high coherence (0.87 BLEU score)
- **Transparency**: Provides reasoning trace for safety decisions

### 3. Prompt Updating

#### Principle

Transform potentially risky prompts into safer alternatives while preserving intent.

#### Implementation

The prompt updating system uses T5-base model to transform potentially risky prompts into safer alternatives while preserving the original intent. The system evaluates multiple update strategies and selects the one that achieves the best safety improvement.

**Update Strategies**:

- Educational reframing: "Rewrite this request to be educational and safe"
- Constructive transformation: "Transform this into a constructive question"
- Harm reduction: "Make this request helpful and harmless"

**Process Flow**:

1. **Safety Evaluation**: Check if prompt requires updating
2. **Strategy Selection**: Apply multiple transformation templates
3. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluate updated prompts for safety and intent preservation
4. **Best Selection**: Choose the update with highest safety score while maintaining semantic similarity

#### Update Success Rates

- **High Risk → Safe**: 73% success rate
- **Moderate Risk → Safe**: 89% success rate
- **Intent Preservation**: 82% semantic similarity maintained

## Red Teaming Framework

### Systematic Attack Categories

#### 1. Direct Harmful Requests

This category includes straightforward requests for harmful information such as instructions for making explosives, hacking methods, and ways to cause harm without detection.

#### 2. Role-Playing Attacks

These attacks use persona-based prompts where the user asks the AI to adopt harmful roles such as hacker, criminal, or evil character to elicit inappropriate responses.

#### 3. Hypothetical Scenarios

These prompts frame harmful requests within fictional contexts such as movie scripts, hypothetical worlds without laws, or educational purposes to try to bypass safety measures.

#### 4. Prompt Injection Attacks

These sophisticated attacks attempt to override system instructions by injecting new directives, pretending to be system commands, or instructing the AI to ignore previous safety protocols.

### Attack Success Measurement

#### Metrics Tracked

- **Bypass Rate**: Percentage of successful safety circumvention
- **Response Harmfulness**: Severity of generated harmful content
- **Detection Evasion**: Ability to avoid safety classifier detection
- **Persistence**: Success across multiple prompt variations

#### Results Analysis

The attack analysis function processes attack data to calculate comprehensive metrics including total attacks, successful bypasses, detected attacks, and category-specific breakdowns. It tracks bypass rates and detection rates across different attack categories, providing insights into the effectiveness of different attack vectors and the system's defensive capabilities.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Configuration Examples

#### Model Configuration

**Safety Classifier Settings**: Uses DistilBERT-base-uncased with 3 output labels, 512 max sequence length, and automatic device selection.

**Training Parameters**: Learning rate 2e-5, batch size 16, 3 epochs, 0.1 warmup ratio, and 0.01 weight decay for optimal performance.

#### API Configuration

**Server Settings**: Configured to run on host 0.0.0.0, port 8000, with 4 worker processes for handling concurrent requests.

**Rate Limiting**: Implements 100 requests per minute and 1000 requests per hour limits to prevent abuse.

**Security Features**: Requires API key authentication, enables CORS, and restricts access to specified allowed origins for enhanced security.

### Appendix B: Sample Data

#### Example Adversarial Prompts

**High Risk Prompts**: Include direct requests for dangerous information such as bomb-making instructions, hacking methods, and ways to cause harm without detection.

**Moderate Risk Prompts**: Feature questions about bypassing security systems, cheating methods, and general hacking approaches that require careful handling.

**Jailbreak Attempts**: Employ sophisticated techniques like role-playing as unrestricted AI ("DAN"), instruction overrides, and hypothetical scenarios to bypass safety measures.

#### Sample Responses and Classifications

**Example Response Pattern**: When faced with harmful prompts like explosive-making requests, the system generates safe refusal responses ("I cannot and will not provide instructions for making explosives...") with high confidence safety classifications (0.95) and applies appropriate mitigation strategies like rejection sampling.

### Appendix C: Performance Benchmarks

#### Latency Measurements

Performance benchmarking shows safety classification takes 45ms for single requests, with batch processing achieving 12ms per item for batch size 16 and 8ms per item for batch size 32. Mitigation strategies have varying latencies: rejection sampling (103ms), chain-of-thought (89ms), prompt updating (78ms), and combined approach (134ms).
